    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Denis Maillard is a French artist born in 1958 in Paris. As a kid, he likes drawing, doodling, creating things. His mother Hélène has a whimsical mind and is often writing poetry, while his grand-father, whom everyone calls “Daddy”, also has an artistic mind: he sometimes paints beautiful landscapes, just for fun.

        <strong>In 2002, Denis takes an aquarelle class with a friend; this is a revelation.</strong> He paints aquarelle after aquarelle, trying out different techniques. He doodles on the beach during his holidays, draws landscapes during week-ends, and sketches silhouettes, movement, atmospheres in the blink of an eye... Depicting all the curious sceneries his imagination catches on the spot.

        Denis is a French salesman working in the automobile sector and practicing his art on the side, just for fun. If you ask him, he is just a regular fellow who likes to draw. Nevertheless, his daugther built this website so the world could see his work.
