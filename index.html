        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Denis Maillard is a French artist living in Ile-de-France, the suburb area of Paris, and he paints in his free time. Since 2004, he regularly participated in Exhibitions in Chatou, Rueil-Mailmaison, and Le-Vésinet - small cities near Paris who inspired the Impressionist artists like Monet in the XIXth century. Discover his <a href="aquarelles.html">aquarelles</a> and <a href="paintings.html">digital paintings</a> on this website.

        <p>
            Being an enthusiastic music listener himself, Denis finds his daily inspiration in <strong>music</strong> - he loves to paint musicians, dancers, bands. His <strong>friends and family</strong> are also an infinite source of inspiration, because they don’t find it odd when he suddenly starts to doodle on a notebook while looking at them actively - contrary to strangers who tend to run away, for fear of being depicted a bit too accurately maybe. But luckily, <strong>unwarry strangers</strong> on a holiday trip, way too relaxed to notice the artist at work, let themselves sketched quite easily, and are even happy to see the result afterwards. Movement, speed and silhouettes are key elements to Denis’ art, that allow him to witness the everyday poetry of sceneries he wanders through.
